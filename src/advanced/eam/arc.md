# Authenticated Received Chain

> ___This is a DRAFT for future releases___

The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) protocol provides an authenticated "chain of custody" for a message, allowing each entity that handles the message to see what entities handled it before and what the message's authentication assessment was at each step in the handling.

> The current RFC is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for examination, experimental implementation, and evaluation.

Until ARC RFC is not released as an "Internet Standard" the vSMTP implementation should be considered as a "work in progress". However it represents the consensus of the IETF community. It has received public review and has been approved for publication by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG).

The implementation of this feature in the vSMTP framework is planned for a future release.
