# Authenticated Received Chain

> ___This is a DRAFT for future releases___

The Authenticated Received Chain (ARC) protocol provides an authenticated "chain of custody" for a message. Each entity that handles the message knows the entities that previously handled it and its authentication assessment at each step in the handling.

> The current RFC is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for examination, experimental implementation, and evaluation.

The vSMTP implementation should be considered as a "work in progress". However it represents the consensus of the IETF community. It has received public review and has been approved for publication by the Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG).
