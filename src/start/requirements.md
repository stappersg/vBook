# Requirements

vSMTP is a stand-alone application with few kernel interactions, it may run on any system with slight modifications.

> vSMTP is currently under development. There's only a DEBIAN package. Anyway vSMTP can be easily compiled from source code.

## Physical requirements

The current release has been tested and deployed on x86/64 environments.

If you want to use vSMTP on any other CPU architectures, contact us by [opening an issue on github](https://github.com/viridIT/vSMTP/issues/new/choose) or by joining the [official discord server](https://discord.gg/N8JGBRBshf).

## Operating systems

vSMTP is tested and deployed on Ubuntu Server 20.04 with kernel 5.4, but vSMTP **should be compatible** with any recent Linux distributions.

FreeBSD 13.x is supported using the latest port branch which includes Rust 1.60.
NetBSD and OpenBSD supports are planned for Q3-2022.

Microsoft Windows Server is not supported.
