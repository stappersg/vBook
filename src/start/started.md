# Getting Started

Before we begin, we would like to thank you for trying vSMTP as your Mail Transfer Agent.

We will walk you through it, step-by-step.
There are four main parts:

- Installing vSMTP on Linux or FreeBSD.
- Configuring vSMTP for a personal usage.
- Hardening your new configuration.
- Using a third party software like clamAV.

Let's start our journey in the wonderful world of Mail Transfer Agents.
