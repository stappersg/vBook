# Brand Indicators for Message Identification

> ___This is a DRAFT for v0.12 features___

Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) permits Domain Owners to coordinate with Mail User Agents (MUAs) to display brand-specific Indicators next to properly authenticated messages.  

While the previous authentication and identification methods work in the background, BIMI is the first whose objective is to make visible and strengthen a brand on the front-end side. The logo is displayed within the user interface of the recipient's webmail.

There are two aspects of BIMI coordination:

1. A scalable mechanism for Domain Owners to publish their desired Indicators
2. A mechanism for Mail Transfer Agents (MTAs) to verify the authenticity of the Indicator.

> BIMI status is "Internet-Draft". It is inappropriate to use Internet-Drafts as reference material. It should be considered as a "work in progress" document.

The implementation of this feature in the vSMTP framework is planned for version 0.12.
