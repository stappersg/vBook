# Domain Name System configuration

vSMTP can manage complex DNS situations. The default configuration can be updated for each virtual domain. DNS parameters are stored in the `[server.dns.config]` and `[server.virtual.dns.config]`tables.

> vSMTP relies on Benjamin Fry's [Trust-DNS] crate to handle DNS queries. 

Please refer to vSMTP reference guide and [Trust-DNS] repository for detailed information.

## DNS resolver

The default behavior is to use Google Public DNS as the upstream resolvers. However using the `type` keyword this can be easily changed to:

- The CloudFlare Public DNS
- The host configuration (/etc/resolv.conf)
- A fully customized resolver

```toml
[server.dns]
type = "system" | "custom" | "google" | "cloudflare"
```

Please see Google and CloudFlare privacy statement for important information about what they track.

## Available options

DNS Options can be set in the TOML `[server.dns.options]` and `[server.virtual.dns.options]` tables.


| Parameter | value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| timeout | integer | Specify the timeout for a request. Defaults to 5 seconds
| attempts | integer | usize Number of retries after lookup failure before giving up. Defaults to 2
| rotate | true/false | Rotate through the resource records in the response (if there is more than one for a given name)
| validate | true/false | Use DNSSec to validate the request
| ip_strategy | enum[^ip] | The ip_strategy for the Resolver to use when lookup Ipv4 or Ipv6 addresses
| cache_size | usize | Cache size is in number of records (some records can be large)
| Use_hosts_file | true/false | check /ect/hosts file before dns requery (only works for unix like OS)

[^Ã®p]: Ipv4Only, Ipv6Only, Ipv4AndIpv6, Ipv6thenIpv4, Ipv4thenIpv6,

Example :

```toml
[server.dns]
type = cloudflare

[server.dns.options]
timeout = 5s

```

Advanced parameters are available. Please check vSMTP reference guide and [Trust-DNS] repository for detailed 
information.

domain = "example.dns.com"
search = ["example.dns.com"]
